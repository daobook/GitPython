"GitPython is a python library used to interact with git repositories, "
"high-level like git-porcelain, or low-level like git-plumbing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/intro.rst:9
msgid ""
"It provides abstractions of git objects for easy access of repository "
"data, and additionally allows you to access the git repository more "
"directly using either a pure python implementation, or the faster, but "
"more resource intensive git command implementation."

"The object database implementation is optimized for handling large "
"quantities of objects and large datasets, which is achieved by using low-"
"level structures and data streaming."

"Installing GitPython is easily done using `pip`_. Assuming it is "

#: ../../source/intro.rst:39
msgid ""
"This command will download the latest version of GitPython from the "

"In this case, you have to manually install `GitDB`_ as well. It would be "

"GitPython is not suited for long-running processes (like daemons) as it "
"tends to leak system resources. It was written in a time where "
"destructors (as implemented in the `__del__` method) still ran "
"deterministically."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/intro.rst:68
msgid ""
"In case you still want to use it in such a context, you will want to "
"search the codebase for `__del__` implementations and call these yourself"
" when you see fit."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/intro.rst:71

"Another way assure proper cleanup of resources is to factor out GitPython"
